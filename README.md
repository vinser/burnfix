# burnfix

**Try to fix screen image retentions and burn in, look for screen defects**

After turning off or moving the taskbar in Windows, you suddenly find that the logo in the corner of the window and the search magnifier are still visible on your monitor or TV screen, although not as brightly.

This is the so-called **imagr retention** or **burn-in**.

You can try to get rid of this effect on your LCD, LED or plasma screen by showing for some time a special moving image (signal pattern[^2]) generated by the application.

Moreover, with this application, you can identify defects in the display matrix by viewing full-screen solid images of different colors. 

Enjoy!

## Building

Burnfix compiles into a statically linked binary with no explicit runtime dependencies. 

Compiling requires a [Go](https://go.dev) compiler (v1.18 or later is required) and the [prerequisites for Fyne](https://developer.fyne.io/started/)[^1].

Systems with the above compile-time requirements satisfied can build the project using `go build` in the project root:
```
git clone https://github.com/vinser/burnfix.git
go build
```

[^1] Burnfix was created using [Fyne](https://fyne.io) toolkit  
[^2] Similar Signal Pattern was used to remove after images on Samsung Plasma Displa Panels and they clamed it to be more effective then All White signal
