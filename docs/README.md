# burnfix

After turning off or moving the taskbar in Windows, you suddenly discover that the window corner logo and the search magnifying glass are still visible on the screen of your monitor or TV, albeit not so brightly. This is the so-called **image retention** or **burn in**. 

Once a similar effect was manifested on plasma panels, but as it turned out, LCD and LED displays can also be affected by it. In some cases, such changes are irreversible, especially when a static image is displayed continuously for many days. But you can try to get rid of this effect by showing a special pattern on the screen. This pattern was built into my old Samsung plasma TV more than 10 years ago. Therefore, having discovered this effect on my modern 4K IPS monitor, I decided to code this simple application that might help you too.  

In addition, using this application you can identify defects of display matrix by looking at solid images in different colors.  

Enjoy!
